Arguments that are passed into a method call in the wrong order can lead to hard-to-spot bugs in code. When these method parameters are of the same type, the compiler will not warn you that you have
passed them in the wrong order, and no static analysis tool currently highlight this issue.
<p>
  This IntelliJ plugin adds a new code inspection under <b>Java &gt; Probable Bugs</b>: <b>Parameters should be passed in the correct order</b>
</p>
<p>
  Running a code analysis on you project with this inspection enabled will highlight places where you may be passing parameters in the wrong order.
</p>
<b>Example</b>
You have a method:
<code>
public void insert(String firstName, String lastName) {
    db.savePerson(firstName, lastName);
}
</code>

However, in one part of your code, you have accidentally passed the arguments in the wrong order:
<code>
insert(lastName, firstName);
</code>
<p>
  The compier will not complain, because both arguments are the same type: <code>String</code>.
</p>
<p>
  Running a code analysis with this plugin installed will warn that you are passing arguments in the wrong order.
