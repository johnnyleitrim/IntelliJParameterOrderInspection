Arguments that are passed into a method call in the wrong order can lead to hard-to-spot bugs in code. When these method
parameters are of the same type, the compiler will not warn you that you have passed them in the wrong order, and no
static analysis tool currently highlight this issue.

Running a code analysis on you project with this inspection enabled will highlight places where you may be passing
parameters in the wrong order. For example:
<!-- tooltip end -->
<pre><code>
  public void insert(String firstName, String lastName) {
    db.savePerson(firstName, lastName);
  }
</code></pre>
However, in one part of your code, you have accidentally passed the arguments in the wrong order:
<pre><code>
  insert(lastName, firstName);
</code></pre>
The compier will not complain, because both arguments are the same type: String. Running a code analysis with this
plugin installed will warn that you are passing arguments in the wrong order.
<p>
    Use the field below to to specify the minimum number of argument order violations that must be present for problems
    to be registered with a call.
